# DEUNIFI

Deunifi is a project in the Ethereum network that integrates the protocols MakerDAO, UniswapV2 and dYdX, with the objective of simplify investment operations that, to be achieved, require multiple transactions and that have high costs.

The idea here is to get the same results, only with one transaction, and with lower costs.

I you want more information about the project, please check out the documentation: https://docs.deunifi.org/
